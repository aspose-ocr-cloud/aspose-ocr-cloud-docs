Aspose.OCR Cloud can find and read only certain areas of an image, not all text. This is very useful for batch processing uniform documents such as ID cards, visas, driverâ€™s licenses, applications, and so on.

The text is extracted from [bitmap or vector images](/ocr/supported-file-formats/) in 3 API calls:

1. [Get access token](/ocr/authorization/)
2. [Send image for recognition](/ocr/send-image-regions-for-recognition/)
3. [Fetch region recognition results](/ocr/fetch-region-recognition-result/)

Because Aspose.OCR Cloud is provided as a REST API, region recognition can be performed from any platform with Internet access.

Aspose also provides open-source [SDKs](/ocr/region-recognition-sdk/) for all popular programming languages, that wrap all routine image recognition operations into a few native methods. It makes interaction with Aspose.OCR Cloud services much easier, allowing you to focus on the task at hand rather than technical details.
