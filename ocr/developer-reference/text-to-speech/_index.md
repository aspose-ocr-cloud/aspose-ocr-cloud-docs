Aspose.OCR Cloud can go beyond extracting text from images. With it, you can convert the recognition results into a natural human voice that can be played in the background or downloaded:

1. [Get access token](/ocr/authorization/)
2. [Send text for conversion](/ocr/send-text-to-speech/)
3. [Fetch audio](/ocr/fetch-voice/)

At the moment, the Aspose.OCR Cloud API can only read aloud English texts.

Because Aspose.OCR Cloud is provided as a REST API, text to speech conversion can be performed from any platform with Internet access.

Aspose also provides open-source [SDKs](/ocr/table-recognition-sdk/) for all popular programming languages, that wrap all routine table recognition operations into a few native methods. It makes interaction with Aspose.OCR Cloud services much easier, allowing you to focus on the task at hand rather than technical details.

Make sure the application has access to the **api.aspose.cloud** domain.
