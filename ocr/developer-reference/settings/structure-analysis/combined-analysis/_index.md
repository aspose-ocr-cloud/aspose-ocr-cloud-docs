The [combination](/ocr/structure-analysis/combined/) of [complex structure analysis](/ocr/structure-analysis/complex/) and [text area analysis](/ocr/structure-analysis/text/) allows you to extract as much text from an image as possible. The OCR engine detects large blocks of text (such as paragraphs and columns), while the remaining content is analyzed by [text area analysis](/ocr/structure-analysis/text/) algorithm.

This allows you to handle even the most complex cases like posters, billboards, or random photos.

As any universal approach, it can take a little longer and may be less efficient than the specialized ones. Try [complex structure analysis](/ocr/structure-analysis/complex/) or [text area analysis](/ocr/structure-analysis/text/) if you know the content type.
