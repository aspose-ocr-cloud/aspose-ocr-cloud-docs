Aspose.OCR Cloud can find certain areas of an image, such as text paragraphs, tables, annotation, and the like. This can help you prepare, configure and debug the extraction of text from complexly formatted publications, such as magazine articles and books.

Region detection is done in 3 API calls:

1. [Get access token](/ocr/authorization/)
2. [Send image for region detection](/ocr/send-for-detection/)
3. [Fetch regions](/ocr/fetch-regions/)

Because Aspose.OCR Cloud is provided as a REST API, region detection can be performed from any platform with Internet access.

Aspose also provides open-source [SDKs](/ocr/region-detection-sdk/) for all popular programming languages, that wrap all routine region detection operations into a few native methods. It makes interaction with Aspose.OCR Cloud services much easier, allowing you to focus on the task at hand rather than technical details.
