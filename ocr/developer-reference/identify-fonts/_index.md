Have you ever been inspired by a font in an image and wondered how to find typefaces in a similar style? Got a sample image from a customer with no reference to the font used? Wanted the best way to put a text overlay on top of the original image?

Aspose.OCR Cloud offers a special API for detecting fonts in a scanned or photographed image. Identification is done in 3 API calls:

1. [Get access token](/ocr/authorization/)
2. [Send image for font identification](/ocr/send-image-for-font-identification/)
3. [Fetch font identification results](/ocr/fetch-font-identification-result/)

Because Aspose.OCR Cloud is provided as a REST API, font identification can be performed from any platform with Internet access.

Aspose also provides open-source [SDKs](/ocr/font-identification-sdk/) for all popular programming languages, that wrap all routine font identification operations into a few native methods. It makes interaction with Aspose.OCR Cloud services much easier, allowing you to focus on the task at hand rather than technical details.
