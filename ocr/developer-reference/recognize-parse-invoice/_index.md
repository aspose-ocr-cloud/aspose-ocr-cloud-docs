Invoices are commonly exchanged as scanned documents in many business and financial transactions. Aspose.OCR Cloud extends beyond traditional optical character recognition by employing natural language processing to extract specific information from invoices and filters out specific information from them. The results can serve various purposes, such as generating summary reports, stored in a database, or seamlessly integrated into accounting, financial, and banking software.

The processing is performed in 3 API calls:

1. [Get access token](/ocr/authorization/)
2. [Send invoice for recognition](/ocr/send-invoice-for-recognition/)
3. [Fetch machine-readable invoice data](/ocr/fetch-invoice-recognition-result/)

Because Aspose.OCR Cloud is provided as a REST API, invoice processing can be performed from any platform with Internet access.

Aspose also provides open-source [SDKs](/ocr/invoice-recognition-sdk/) for all popular programming languages, that wrap all routine invoice processing into a few native methods. It makes interaction with Aspose.OCR Cloud services much easier, allowing you to focus on the task at hand rather than technical details.
