Almost all organizations offer their employees to reimburse travel expenses, network fees, and other payments confirmed by receipts. However, manual reprinting of receipts is time consuming, often leads to errors and even waste of money.

Aspose.OCR Cloud offers a special recognition model that extracts text from scanned receipts, which can then be automatically sent to corporate platforms for approval and reimbursement. The recognition is performed in 3 API calls:

1. [Get access token](/ocr/authorization/)
2. [Send receipt for recognition](/ocr/send-receipt-for-recognition/)
3. [Fetch receipt recognition results](/ocr/fetch-receipt-recognition-result/)

Because Aspose.OCR Cloud is provided as a REST API, receipt recognition can be performed from any platform with Internet access.

Aspose also provides open-source [SDKs](/ocr/receipt-recognition-sdk/) for all popular programming languages, that wrap all routine receipt recognition operations into a few native methods. It makes interaction with Aspose.OCR Cloud services much easier, allowing you to focus on the task at hand rather than technical details.
