Aspose.OCR Cloud extracts text from [bitmap or vector images](/ocr/supported-file-formats/) in 3 API calls:

1. [Get access token](/ocr/authorization/)
2. [Send image for recognition](/ocr/send-image-for-recognition/)
3. [Fetch image recognition results](/ocr/fetch-image-recognition-result/)

Because Aspose.OCR Cloud is provided as a REST API, image recognition can be performed from any platform with Internet access.

Aspose also provides open-source [SDKs](/ocr/image-recognition-sdk/) for all popular programming languages, that wrap all routine image recognition operations into a few native methods. It makes interaction with Aspose.OCR Cloud services much easier, allowing you to focus on the task at hand rather than technical details.
