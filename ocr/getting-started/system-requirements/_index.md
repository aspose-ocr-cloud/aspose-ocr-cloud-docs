**Aspose.OCR Cloud** is an on-demand service hosted in Aspose Cloud. As such, it has no specific device or operating system requirements and can be used with any programming language that supports HTTPS requests: .NET, Java, JavaScript (Node.js and AJAX), Python, and many more. It can run on servers, desktops, thin clients, smartphones and tablets.

You can also use third party REST clients like _cURL_ or _Postman_.

The only requirement is that the device must have access to the Internet and the application must not be blocked by a firewall.
