Aspose.OCR Cloud is an on-demand service with a free tier. You must [register](/ocr/sign-up/) with **Aspose Cloud API** to access the optical character recognition features.

## Evaluation tier

You can try Aspose.OCR Cloud without subscribing for a paid plan and even without creating an account at Aspose Cloud API. The following APIs are available for free:

Method | Limitations
------ | -----------
[Image recognition](/ocr/recognize-image/) | **10%** of the words in recognition results are substituted with asterisks (`*`). The sequence of masked words remains unchanged upon re-submitting the identical image for recognition.
[Text to speech conversion](/ocr/text-to-speech/) | <ul><li>**10** API calls per day from a single IP address.</li><li>The text size must not exceed **500** characters, including spaces and punctuation.</li><li>The phrase _"Please authenticate to the API to remove this message"_ is inserted at a random position within the generated audio.</li></ul>

If you have already hit the limits or need access to other methods, consider the [free tier](#free-tier) or [paid subscription plan](#paid-plans).

## Free tier

This plan is automatically granted to you when you sign up for a new account. It allows you to access all Aspose.OCR Cloud features with with a monthly data processing limit. Free tier allows you to use Aspose.OCR Cloud API from any number of applications, with a maximum of **150** API calls per month. As long as you stay within the limits, you can also perform concurrent requests.

Apart from the limit on the number of API calls, there are no other restrictions. We do not limit the size of a document recognized per request.

The free tier allows you to familiarize yourself with the service, explore its capabilities, and begin the development. However, once you exceed the limits, you must sign up for a paid plan to continue.
