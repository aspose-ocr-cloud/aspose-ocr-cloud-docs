Aspose.OCR Cloud is a REST API for extracting text from scans, photos, screenshots, and reading areas of an image. It can also convert scanned PDFs into searchable and indexable documents where you can select and copy text. Our API supports 49 European, Cyrillic, Eastern, and Indic scripts, as well as Chinese.

With Aspose.OCR Cloud, you do not have to worry about complex and resource-intensive machine learning algorithms. Running as an online service on highly reliable and high performance GPU-based Amazon servers, it offers an easy-to-use, fast and secure REST API that allows you to perform the translation and conversion with a single HTTPS call from any device or platform, including entry-level smartphones and legacy PCs.

Aspose.OCR Cloud also comes with open-source software development kits (SDKs) for almost any platform, which handle all the routine operations such as establishing connections, sending API requests, and parsing responses.
