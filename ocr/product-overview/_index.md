Aspose.OCR Cloud is a powerful, versatile and cost-effective REST API for optical character recognition. It can extract text from scanned images, photos, screenshots, PDF files, areas of images, and web links in European, Cyrillic, Eastern scripts, and Chinese, maintaining the original layout, structure, and formatting.

With Aspose.OCR Cloud, you do not have to worry about complex and resource-intensive machine learning algorithms. Running as an online service on highly reliable and high performance GPU-based Amazon servers, it offers an easy-to-use, fast and secure REST API that allows you to perform the translation and conversion with a single HTTPS call from any device or platform, including entry-level smartphones and legacy PCs.

Aspose.OCR Cloud also comes with open-source software development kits (SDKs) for .NET, Java, Python, Node.js, and Android, which handle all the routine operations such as establishing connections, sending API requests, and parsing responses.
